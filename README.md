ATPAD: An Accessible Tool for RUOA-UNAM Atmospheric Data Processing and Visualization

Several regions of the world are making an effort to meet the atmospheric monitoring needs of each region to generate accurate information for the study of meteorology, 
climate change and air quality. Monitoring networks generate a large amount of information that needs to be stored, validated, corrected, and interpreted, however, 
practical tools are not always available for the development of these activities without the need to resort to highly trained personnel, thus limiting the way the general population's 
access to atmospheric monitoring information. This work presents a tool for the basic processing and visualization of atmospheric monitoring data, specifically from the 
University Network of Atmospheric Observatories (RUOA) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. ATPAD (Accessible Tool for Processing Atmospheric RUOA Data) is a project developed in Python 
that allows the manipulation and visualization of pre-processed databases in an easy and freely accessible way.
